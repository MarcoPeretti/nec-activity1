**Update:** Created 'NeuralNet' class with initial structure of the neural network.  
Backpropagation and forward propagation are not coded yet.

### Implemented
- Variables initialization  
- Dynamic structure of layers

###  To check / next steps
- Activation functions (only sigmoid for now)  
- Weight and bias initialization using values from '0' to '1' 
  → Check if range should be '-1' to '1' in documentation
- Check and correct the code to be able to create adidtional layers or neurons.
